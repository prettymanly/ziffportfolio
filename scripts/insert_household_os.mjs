    title: 'Household OS: Designing a Shared Layer for Family Life',
    copy:
      'In many Southeast Asian households, especially in the Philippines, the home is not just a space, but a system: a network of care, financial interdependence, and decision-making spread across parents, siblings, overseas workers, and elders. Amid this complexity, families already manage using mental checklists, handwritten logs, Viber threads, and spreadsheets.\n\nSo when a major conglomerate approached us to explore a "super app," we asked a different question:\n\nWhat if we didn\'t just digitize transactions but supported the actual work of running a household?',

      'Through interviews, co-creation sessions, and ethnographic research, we surfaced the quiet complexity of everyday life: multiple household members taking on roles like contributor, payer, planner, or reminder, often across generations and time zones.\n\nWe reframed the challenge: How might we design for family coordination, not just individual utility?\n\nThe result was the early blueprint of a Household OS, not a dashboard of bills, but a support layer that acknowledged the labour, trust, and emotion embedded in shared living.',

We designed logic for real-life dynamics: overseas earners sending money home, elders passing on responsibilities, or blended families navigating new norms.\n\nThe design had to do more than work; it had to respect power dynamics, invite participation, and leave room for dignity.\n\nThis project reframed digital transformation from convenience to care infrastructure â€” a quiet revolution in how platforms can show up for real lives.',
